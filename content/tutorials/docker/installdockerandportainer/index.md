Docker is a popular platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Portainer is a management tool for Docker that makes it easy to manage your containers, images, networks, and volumes. In this article, we'll show you how to install these tools on a Linux server.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure that you have a Linux server set up and that you have administrative access to that server.

## Updating the Package Index

Before installing Docker, it is important to update the package index on your server. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

## Installing Docker CE

Next, we'll install Docker CE (Community Edition) by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

## Starting the Docker Daemon

Once the installation is complete, we need to start the Docker daemon by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## Installing Docker Compose

To install Docker Compose, we need to download the latest version of the binary and make it executable. We can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## Verifying the Docker and Docker Compose Installations

To verify that the Docker and Docker Compose installations were successful, we can run the following commands:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## Installing Portainer

To install Portainer, we can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock portainer/portainer
```

This command will download the Portainer image and run a container based on that image, exposing Portainer on port 9000.

## Accessing Portainer

Once the Portainer container is running, we can access the Portainer web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to <http://your_server_ip:9000>. We should see the Portainer login screen.

## Conclusion

In this article, we showed you how to install Docker, Docker Compose, and Portainer on a Linux server. You can now start using Docker to build, ship, and run your applications, and use Portainer to manage your Docker environment.
