Greetings and welcome to the inaugural post on the Computer Hacking 101 website. In this blog, we aim to keep you informed about our ongoing projects and updates to our YouTube channel and website.

As part of our efforts to enhance the website's functionality, we have transitioned from WordPress to Hugo, a contemporary and robust website builder. As we continue to refine the website's design, some changes may occur over time.

We are pleased to announce that we have an upcoming video titled "How to Use Syncthing" scheduled for release in the next few weeks. Additionally, we have recently acquired a 1u server case that we will be transferring our Promox server to, which will be the subject of a future video.

Please note that due to our team's work commitments and personal obligations, video releases may be infrequent. However, we are committed to delivering high-quality content, and we appreciate your patience and understanding.
