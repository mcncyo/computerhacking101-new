## move to another server

I am now hosting this website on my own server located at my house.   I am using Cloudflare tunnel, Cloudflare catch, docker, GitHub, and Jenkins to create and host this and my personal site.   I will make multiple videos on how to do this.  It took me a while to set it up correctly.

## still fixing a few issues with the website

I still need to fix a few more issues on this website.  The doc page is still messed up, and I have some SEO things to make the website better to find in search engines.  I still need to get the copy-and-paste to work correctly.

## youtube channel

Sorry, getting the syncthing video up and running has been taking forever.  I had some issues when I was recording it.  I have recorded it three times, and there are some spots I need to rerecord again.  Then I have to finish editing it.  I am still learning DaVinci Resolve, so it takes some time to create the video.
